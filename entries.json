We discussed the general topics of 'Epics', 'Themes', and 'Tasks' with regards to the 'User Stories'.

I'm not sure how deep it can go, but it really is almost on-par with Python in terms of funcionality. from what I've seen, the few things it doesn't do out of the box is accessing things like file storage (obviously), and to seems like python has better user interface in terms of graphics, keyboard inputs, etc.<br><br>We also introduce real for-loops, boolean tertiary statements, date functions. My problem going forward is going to be remembering semi-colons after each line."},

It doesn't need to be just a text box. You can create and display HTML, forms, buttons, anything on the fly."},

The things we need to add is a way to read out blogs from the JSON file into our homepage and display it. jQueries .getJSON() function runs asynchronously, so you have to accomodate for this. If you need to use the data at anypoint (ie. to display our blog) you need to wait for the read to finish, because otherwise your javascript will just keep running without realizing it hasn't been read yet. You could just use a timeout timer, but to do it properly you should wait for the JSON.complete flag, as a trigger for other events.<br><br>In addition to reading the blog, we need to split it (the instructors are calling it pagination?) into sections of 5 pages. Finally, we need to be able to search through all the blogs and display only the blogs that match our search field. In addition we need to add some animations to hide the main homepage when we start searching, and only show our search results."},

It is a survey generator. Meaning, it is a tool for an administrator to quickly build a survey from a list of modules (ie. check box questions, text box questions, pass-word, slider, all sorts of form objects). From there, he can fill out additional information like the text of the question, any images he wants, values for the radio buttons etc.<br><br>From there, they can generate emails to send out to people with a custom hash, so that no one can fill it out more than once.<br><br>Obviously, people can then take the survey.

The guys running the front end have a really awesome start going. I think my achritecture of the design is going to work really well, and so far it's let them be super modular and independent. No file conflicts so far. No ones duplicating work. My afternoon however has been a massive struggle with Dave's Web host. We are not sure why but it's just not working. It works for straight Python, but when you try to get it working with Javascript it's full of Cross-Origina Conflict errors. We've tried a lot of tricks we found online, with Chrome and firefox add-ins, proxy servers, etc. In the end, nothing has worked. Dave is going to stay late tonight with my test functions and his server, and try to figure it out. Hopefully tomorrow moring, we'll have it worked out."},

I am not having much luck either. We are looking at cookies, but I'm not really sure that's the best method to go. We found a javascript library to create cookies and read them, but it seems like it would be super easy to hack (at least for the library we were looking at). It seemed like it was just a key-value pair. So it seems like it would be super easy to copy. Maybe I'm wrong. Instead the only thing we could come up with is to repeatedly query the server-side to authenticate. Maybe something else will come up over the weekend. We'll only have about 4 hours on monday before we need to present."},

We were so close and couldn't quite tie the final knots together. The instructors said we did great work (I think they overloaded us on purpose to try to push our limits), but again... Sooo Close to an actual project. We had the survey build portion down pat. No problems there. We had some minor tweaking to do on the End-user survey reader. In my opinion, for a minimum viable product, we need to finish the Administrator authentication, and add the administrator review page.<br><br>That being said, the parts we did have looked really good in the end. I'd like to add a little more functionality on my own, before I'd consider it \"presentable\" as a portfolio worthy piece. Clean up some of the code and such, but it's not bad. Speaking of portfolio, I need to find time to clean up some of my older projects as well. Asteroids and such. They have us running so fast, there's no chance to backtrack yet. Maybe this weekend, if I don't have homework."},

It's not that Javascript and Python weren't fun (they really were honestly), but this is the reason I came to devCodeCamp. I hear the demand for C# programmers is pretty high in the Milwaukee area. Don't get me wrong, if I was offered a job in either Python or Javascript, I'd jump at the opportunity, but I have a feeling there are more opportunities out there in the C#/business world.<br><br>We started off the day with some real good lectures about C# organization and objected oriented programming.<br><br>Specifically, I had seen DLL's, EXE's, classes and namespaces before but, for example, I never REALLY understood what a namespace was, and what their full scope was. Like when did you need to use a \"using\" call, and when could you just let the namespace scope take control. I've never seen a good explanation what it was in any tutorials, but now it makes total sense.<br><br>We also got some information on the S.O.L.I.D. programming paradigm.<br>- Single Responsibility - do one thing, and do it well<br>- Open/Closed principal - keep your classes open for extension, but closed to modification<br>- Liskov Substitution principal - Any child should be able to fill in for a parent class, without causing a breakdown<br>- Interface Segregation - since you can inherit multiple interfaces, keep them tight and specific, don't use a single all-encompassing interface, that future users might not need.<br>- Dependency Inversion Principal - Design for the big-picture, not the specific details. (ie. if you are making a calculator, don't design for 2+2 = 4, design for the big picture, sum(1,2,3,4,5,6... etc.)<br><br>"},

I really like how it turned out. I also used the base functions and base constructors we discussed.<br><br>On a side Note:<br>Ben suggested I look into the Dependency Injection and Factory Constructor design patterns. That would allow me to create expandable control responses without having to hard-code responses within the robot class itself. It would be the equivalent of passing in a control module to the robot. And you could swap that control module out, depending upon what you wanted that robot to do... It's a fascinating abstract idea to think about. I'm not sure I have my mind around it just yet, but I like where it's leading.

I can't imagine a scenario where someone would want to make addition and subtraction mean something different, with respect to a calculator, but maybe there is something there. In either case, by injecting the logic as a pass-in, you can change it at run-time if you like."},

Using recussion (and sort of a reverse order of operations technique) I was able to break up the equation into smaller and smaller chunks until it was just the values, and an operator. Then it collapsed the binary tree back, doing all the appropriate calculations that it parsed in. It worked like a charm. I am super impressed with it.

It cannot yet differentiate between a negative number, vs. a subtraction sign. In other words, it would crash if I tried 2 * -2. It would try to subtract 2 from the multiplication sign and fail.<br><br>Our new project is a one-day sprint at refactoring our old Lemonade stand project, redone in C#, instead of Python.<br><br>It was not a success, but we were pretty close.
